# swe-web-app: Tower of Babble

Repository containing our web-application for SWE project (as a part of the coursework of IIT Tirupati), adhering to United Nations Sustainablility Goals

The idea of the project is given in the `Team6 ProjectConcept.docx`. 

## Importance of the project:
Allowing corporations to host our web-applications in their servers, we provide a free, easy and privacy-secure solution for translating and transcribing their data.

## Uniqueness
No other solution exist outside of research domians, and that too do not provide a simplistic way to translate and transcribe text/audio for users

**Long story short: We are building a website that can transcribe and translate input audio/video files to text/srt files using AI based models of Whisper.cpp**


## To Run the website ->

Run the following commands in order
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
